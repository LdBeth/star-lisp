;;; CM:TIME makes sure that when it is timing code,
;;; no error checking is being done.  This is what
;;; the two messages below mean.  They can be ignored.

 Warning: Turning off Paris safety for CM:TIME.
 Warning: Turning off *Lisp safety for CM:TIME.

;;; The first time CM:TIME is called it calculates for
;;; itself how fast the CM clock is running.  This
;;; is what the message below means.  It can be ignored too.

 Calibrating CM idle timer...   Calculated CM clock speed = 6.69698 MHz

;;; Here is the result of our call to CM:TIME.  It says
;;; that the total time to execute our loop 1000 times
;;; was 8.339999 seconds, and that the Connection Machine
;;; was executing for almost all of that time, 8.263904 seconds.

Evaluation of 
(DOTIMES (J 1000) (*SET Y (+!! (!! 4.0) (*!! X (+!! (!! 2.0) (*!! X (!! 3.0))))))) 
took 8.339999 seconds of elapsed time, 
during which the CM was active for 8.263904 seconds or 99.00% of the total elapsed time.

;;; Do it again to insure that we get approimately the

Evaluation of

;;; OK, how many floating point operations per second
;;; is the Connection Machine doing?

;;; 128   = number of virtual processors per physical processor.
;;; 8192  = number of physical processors.
;;; 1000  = number of times we executed the loop.
;;; 4     = number of multiplies (2) plus the number of additions (2)

> (* 128 8192 1000 4)
4194304000

;;; So the above number is the total number of floating point
;;; operations the Connection Machine executed.
;;; If we divide this number by the total amount of
;;; time we will determine the number of floating point
;;; instructions per second (FLOPS) the Connection Machine
;;; is performing.

> (/ * 8.259)
5.078464705170117E8

;;; So the CM is doing 500 million flops, or 500 Megaflops, or 0.5 Gigaflops.
;;; If we had a full 64K CM instead of using an 8K CM, we would multiply
;;; this number by 8, to arrive at 4.0 Gigaflops.

;;; So we can say that a full Connection Machine can evaluate a quadratic
;;; polynomial at a rate of 4.0 Gigaflops.
